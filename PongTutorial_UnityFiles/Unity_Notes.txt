Unity Notes:

*To change the velocity of an object, you must add 'RigidBody' component to it

*Use 'Fixed Rotation: Z Axis' so the 2D object will not tilt randomly

*You always need a 'GameMaster' that persists through all levels, keeps track of scores,
 level, etc. etc. 

*You can create a 'Physics2D Material' & change the friction & gravity settings - you can apply
 that material to a box or circle collider by dragging it into the material box..this will
 modify its behavior when it collides with an object

*Placing 'Static' before the name of a function allows you to call it from anywhere
 within the scene
